            <h5>Monitoring and mapping wildfires using satellite data</h5>
            <p align='justify'>Students will work with data from the Global Wildfire Information System (GWIS) to extract <u>global wildfire statistics</u> 
                for large wildfires. Students will then use pre- and post-wildfire imagery from Sentinel 2 to create wildfire <u>burn 
                perimeters</u>. By combining this with data from other global databases, such as OpenStreetMap, students will be able to 
                investigate the relationships between wildfires and how they affect both the <u>ecosystem and society</u>.
            </p>

            <h5>The change in Earth's albedo and its dependence on land cover changes in the past 20 years</h5>
            <p align='justify'>Students will be given the opportunity to explore <u>terrestrial remote sensing and 
                meteorological data</u> from MODIS and MERRA-2 to extract <u>reflectance, albedo, and meteorological variables</u> 
                and information on <u>land cover change</u> in their region of interest. We encourage students to use this data 
                to investigate the relationships between these variables and how they affect the <u>global radiative budget</u>. 
                In addition, students will track the phenomenon of <u>agricultural land abandonment</u> and map if the lands were 
                abandoned due to climate change.

            <h5>Regional precipitation response to ENSO from the perspective of paleoclimate and climate modeling</h5>
            <p align='justify'>Students will have a chance to analyse <u>climate model data</u> from CESM-LME to study the regional 
                precipitation response to El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) from the perspective of paleoclimate data and 
                climate modeling. In particular, the project will investigate the relationships between <u>precipitation, surface 
                temperature, ENSO index, and external forcings</u> like greenhouse gasses and volcanic eruptions, and how they affect 
                <u>hydrological change</u>, including extreme precipitation and drought events, in the students’ region of interest.

            <div style = 'margin: 0px 50px 0px'>
            <h5>Regional precipitation variability and extreme events</h5>
            <p align='justify'>In this project, students will explore <u>rain gauge and satellite data</u> from CHIRPS and MODIS 
                to extract <u>rain estimates and land surface reflectance</u>, respectively. This data will enable identification 
                of <u>extreme events</u> in the students’ region of interest. Besides investigating the relationships between these 
                variables, students will be encouraged to study the impact of extreme events on <u>changes in vegetation</u>.
            </p>
            <h5>Heatwaves</h5>
            <p align='justify'>Working with <u>climate model and reanalysis data</u> from CMIP6 and ERA5, students will be able to 
                study <u>temperature tendency and heatwaves</u> in their region of interest. There will also be an opportunity to 
                probe how these variables potentially affect the <u>regional ecosystem and agriculture</u>.
            </p>

            <div style = 'margin: 0px 50px 0px'>
            <h5>Sea level rise</h5>
            <p align='justify'>This project will be an opportunity to delve deep into CMIP6 <u>ocean model data</u> to extract 
                information on <u>sea surface height</u> in any region of interest with respect to <u>different climate scenarios</u>. 
                This will be a chance to investigate how sea level changes affect the <u>coastal eco-systems and habitation</u>
                under different warming scenarios.
            </p>

            <h5>Ocean acidification</h5>
            <p align='justify'>Students will be able to analyse <u>ocean model and observational data</u> from global databases 
                to extract variables like <u>pH, CO2, and temperature</u> among others, and to investigate <u>ocean acidification</u> 
                in their region of interest. This project will be an opportunity to investigate the relationships between 
                these variables as well as their <u>impact on the marine ecosystems</u>.
